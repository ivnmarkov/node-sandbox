### Got

**Real-World Use Case:**
- **Large-Scale Web Scraping**: `got` is ideal for scenarios like scraping large-scale websites where handling streams is crucial. Imagine a service that aggregates news from various sources; `got` can efficiently handle multiple requests and stream the data, providing a seamless experience.

**Pros:**
1. **Stream API**: `got` offers a powerful Stream API, which is great for handling large volumes of data efficiently.
2. **Immutability**: The instances are immutable; once created, their options don't change. This means you can safely reuse instances without side-effects.
3. **Advanced Retry and Timeout Options**: `got` has robust mechanisms for retries and handling timeouts, which is crucial for reliable network communication.
4. **HTTP2 Support**: Offers support for HTTP2.

**Cons:**
1. **Learning Curve**: The Stream API and some advanced features can have a steeper learning curve.
2. **Bulkiness**: `got` might be bulkier compared to simpler libraries like `axios`, especially for basic use cases.
3. **No Browser Support**: It's designed for Node.js, so it's not suitable for use in a browser environment.

### Axios

**Real-World Use Case:**
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: A common scenario is using `axios` in a web application to communicate with a backend API. For example, a React app fetching user data from a Node.js server. `axios` is ideal due to its simplicity and browser compatibility.

**Pros:**
1. **Browser and Node.js Support**: `axios` can be used in both browser and Node.js environments, making it versatile.
2. **Promise-based API**: This makes it easy to use with modern JavaScript async/await syntax.
3. **Interceptors**: You can intercept requests and responses, allowing you to modify requests and handle responses globally.
4. **Automatic JSON Data Transformation**: `axios` automatically transforms for JSON data.

**Cons:**
1. **No Stream API**: Unlike `got`, `axios` does not support Node.js streams, which can be a limitation for handling large data transfers efficiently.
2. **Less Robust in Retry and Timeout Handling**: Compared to `got`, `axios` has simpler retry and timeout mechanisms.
3. **Issues with Progress Updates**: There have been reports of challenges in handling progress updates for requests, particularly in the browser.
